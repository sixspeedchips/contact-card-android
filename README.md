## Introduction

Those who work in professional settings may find it common to exchange business cards upon meeting someone new. Business cards provide a concise medium for exchanging useful information about what one does, where one works and how to be easily contacted. In today's world they often function as an advertisement of one's own personal brand. However, frequent exchanges often lead people to accumulation of business cards with no easy way to store or index them.

## Overview

This project is intended to provide an easy method for people to store the business cards they acquire as contacts in their phone. When a rectangle roughly matching the dimensions of a business card enters the frame of the camera a raw image is taken as input, transformed and text is extracted. The extracted text is parsed via trained neural net and offered to the user as a contact where tags can be added and the contact saved. Later implementations may add the ability to search the contact on popular social platforms by returning API queries based on the processed text, which then the user may attempt to add to their own accounts.
