## Usages

The usage of the app is fairly straight forward:

* Upon boot the app launches directly into the camera. I've found it works best to have a good contrast between the background of the card and the surface it lies on. Next start from above and slowly lower the phone down until the app begins to detect the card as indicated by the red bounding boxes. This triggers a change in screen to a preview. 

* If the preview looks good swipe left to go to the contact generator page in which after a short load the app will populated the raw fields and attempt to populate the parsed fields. 
* To go back to the camera just swipe left again, or swipe right to go back to the preview. At anytime the user may access the list of images taken via clicking on the hamburger menu in the upper left, and selecting gallery. To return to the camera, again from the hamburger menu, select camera.
